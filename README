Define the MC Temperature
"Temp = 100"

running VASP with total 128 cores (128 should be consist with your sbatsh files)
"subprocess.run([ 'mpirun', '-n','128', 'vasp_std'])"


Define the the range of MC-DFT steps. the initial one is from 0.
Due to the time limit, it is not possible to finish 1000 step.
"for step in range(0, 1000)"

If the jobs stop at step-400 because of the maximum time limitation of HPC.
Before you submit the sbatch file again.
remove the last folder created by MC-DFT.py, in this case, is step-400.
VASP calculation in step-400 is not finished yet,
then set 
"for step in range(0, 1000)"
to
"for step in range(400, 1000)"

There should be a series of file folder called step_0, step_1, step_2,...
And there is one energy.txt file contain
## step.   the total energy.   accetptance (1 for accepted, 0 for declined)
